Problem Statement
Millions of people delay medical attention due to:
- Lack of awareness about early symptoms  
- Misinformation and unsafe self-diagnosis  
- Healthcare tools that are complex and not user-friendly

 What Makes SymptoSense Different?
- Combines rule-based logic with ML-refined scoring
- Displays Before vs After ML refinement** clearly
- Includes an interactive AI Chat Doctor
- No backend or API dependency
- Clean, calm healthcare-themed UI

Early symptom awareness can significantly reduce health risks, but accessible and intelligent tools are still limited.

1. User Interface Layer
- Interactive symptom selection cards  
- Manual symptom input support  
- Calm, mood-friendly healthcare UI  

2. Disease Knowledge Base
- Predefined symptom sets per disease  
- Disease severity mapping  

3. Risk Analysis Engine
- Base Score: Percentage of matched symptoms  
- ML Refinement: Weighted symptom importance  
- Final Risk Score: Severity-adjusted probability  

4. AI Chat Doctor Module
- Handles symptom-related questions  
- Provides explanations, precautions, and guidance  
- Responds in a friendly, doctor-like tone  

5. Report Generator
- Generates downloadable health reports  
- Includes:
  - Selected symptoms  
  - Before & after ML scores  
  - Risk percentages  
  - Awareness disclaimer  


 AI & ML Logic (Simplified)

- Each symptom is assigned a relevance weight  
- Critical symptoms influence risk more strongly  
- ML refinement improves accuracy while remaining explainable  
- Avoids black-box predictions  

 Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS
- Framework: React.js
- AI Logic: Rule-based logic + weighted ML refinement  

✔ No backend  
✔ No APIs
